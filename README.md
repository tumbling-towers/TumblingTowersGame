# Tumbling Towers

Tumbling Towers is a singleplayer/multiplayer game where users aim to build a tower as high as possible using tetris blocks. The user has to aim to build a stable tower, as the tower is subject to physics and gravity, otherwise the tower will tumble. The user can play with 4 game modes, and with two different power ups. The game supports up to two players. The game is a recreation of the popular Nintendo Switch game, Tricky Towers.

This application was created by a team of 4 NUS students, with the intention to demonstrate the clean modularisation of our code, i.e. the separation of the functionality of our application such that we are able to replace parts of the application easily. We also intend to show the extensibility of our application, i.e. the ease of addition of new features such as new power ups, new game modes, input modes, and more players.

This project won second place at the School of Computing Term Project Showcase (STePS). Check it out [here](https://uvents.nus.edu.sg/event/22nd-steps/module/CS3217/project/2)!
